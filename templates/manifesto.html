<h2>the fuck happened?</h2>
<i>the internet has changed... and it is still changing... web3 and "decentralized" crypto hellhole? who the fuck wants that?</i>
<p>dear netizen, take this as a rambble, or as a manifesto, or whatever but...<br/>
  the internet once was a place for creative expression, vastly customizable; a space for people, by people! not controlled by big corporations.</p>
  <p>this lasted all up until mid-2010s, when they decided to take away any creativity and customizability we once had, they threw it all away, 
  in favor of adverisers and investors. alongside big corporations, clout-chasers and quasi-celebrities, also made everything about the money. 
  its the main reason the internet is so boring nowadays, because if its crazy, weird, and colorful, advertisers won't like it. its time for 
  the individuals like you and me to shine once again, and make internet ours. it's time to make internet enjoyable again! 
  it's time to make internet weird again! i miss the personal, do-it-yourself aspect of everyone having their own homepage, 
  rather than an account within a closed-off social media platform they can't even customize. for an example: youtube, twitter, etc, 
  all used to provide so much customizability, we had so many ways to make our profiles fun, to make them "us". but nope, 
  they had to reduce us to profile picture and banner only, meanwhile also banning gifs pfps. </p>
  <p>so in a nutshell -- yep, they ruined the internet because of the fucking money, but can we really be surprised? the internet isn't a hobby anymore, 
  when majority of people just try to capitalise on any given subject. once money is involved, that is not a hobby, that's a damn job. 
  like it or not, that's facts.</p>
  <p>i really miss the old and simpler internet, it was more fun, more free. i don't remember much of it, as i was really young and 
  quite terrible at english during 2010s, but i do know internet doesn't feel the same, as it once did. i just want that back... 
  we need to keep the internet weird! i perosnally owe the internet my whole life, it might sound pathetic, but without it 
  i would actually be completely alone. all my friends live in fucking narnia or some shit, and without the internet, i would've never met 
  those people.</p>
  <p>apparently, nowadays, they're trying to "fix" the internet by slow introduction of the "decentralized" internet aka web3.0. which is bunch
  of bullshit. they want us to belive this will make internet free again, cos we'll be away from corporations. but how can it be free,
  when blockchain is involved? it won't and can't be free (both as in no cost and as in libre), with blockchain involved. it will
  become even more of a the riche's toy, than it is right now. so in the other words, the literal oposite of what they make us belive.
  i might not be anti-crypto per se, but imagining the blockchain as integral part of the web borders with instanity! 
  </p>
  <p>the goal isnt to dwell on the past, or to ignore the progression - but what they show as "progression", actually isnt it. they made us forget 
  how to actually surf the web, they made us overly-dependent on search engines. people stopped making their own homepages, and those who still
  have a website stopped doing webrings, stopped putting so-called buttons on their sites. everything went downhill since. but the web is in our hands,
  we can continue watching the web decay and rot, or we can start "surfing" again.</p>
