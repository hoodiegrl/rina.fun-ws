<h2>about me!</h2>
<i>hewwo there. my name is rina, and i'm the creator of this website.</i>
<p>i live somewhere in <span style="color:#FF4136">se</span><span style="color:#0074D9">rb</span><span style="color:#ccc">ia</span>. 
i'm your average (or not so average idk and idc) 23-year-old. i like watching cartoons and anime, stuffies, anything cute rly, 
music, playing video games, etc. i also have an "obseesion" with hoodies! but hey, nothing wrong with wanting to be comfy and cosy, right? 
i code, make music myself and write poetry (granted kinda badly). its all for fun, so there's no value. if you expect any kind of maturity, 
you obviusly came to the wong page on the interwebs. i dont have much to offer, this is just a small page for the annoying things i do or like.</p>
